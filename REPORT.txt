- Explain how the arguments make it all the way from user program invoking
  execv until they turn into main's argc, and argv for the target program

- My implementation of execv in syscall.cc is not secure. Show a user
  program that can read any memory address by exploiting my bad code

- How would change the code to protect against this attack

- What do we need to change in order to implement input and output
  redirection and pipes in the shell?
